  <h1>About blood donations</h1>
  <p>
    A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used
    for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process
    called fractionation (separation of whole-blood components). Donation may be
    of whole blood, or of specific components directly (the latter called
    apheresis). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well
    as the procedures that follow it. Today in the developed world, most blood
    donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In
    some countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give
    blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation). Many
    donors donate as an act of charity, but in countries that allow paid
    donation some donors are paid, and in some cases there are incentives other
    than money such as paid time off from work. Donors can also have blood drawn
    for their own future use (autologous donation). Donating is relatively safe,
    but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel
    faint.
